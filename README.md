# UrlSlug

UrlSlug is a slug/permalink plugin with ActiveRecord and I18n support. It lets you create SEO friendly URLs.

With UrlSlug, it's easy to make your application use URLs like:

    https://example.com/posts/this-is-a-friendly-url

or

    https://example.com/posts/123-this-is-a-friendly-url

instead of:

    https://example.com/posts/123

## Usage

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'url_slug'
```

And then execute:

```shell
bundle install
```

Run the generator

```shell
# thor url_slug:install ClassName field:attr --path="path/to/class.rb"
thor url_slug:install Person name:slug --path="libs/person.rb"
```

or add it manually


```ruby
class Person
  include UrlSlug
  url_slug_for :name, attr: :slug

  ...
end

person = Person.new
person.name = "John Doe"
person.slug #=> "john-doe"
```

The `slug` attribute is optional. If you dont define it, then `:name_slug` will be used as attribute

```
  url_slug_for :name # creates :name_slug attribute

  person.name_slug
```

## Ruby on Rails

Run the install generator.

```shell
# rails g url_slug:rails ClassName field:field_slug --migration
rails g url_slug:rails Person name --migration
```

or add it manually

Edit the class file (e.g `app/models/person.rb`):

```ruby
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  include UrlSlug
  url_slug_for :name
end
```

Now when you create a new Person:

```ruby
person = Person.create!(name: "Ivan The Terrible")
person.name_slug #=> "ivan-the-terrible"
```

Optionally, if you want to persist the slug to db, create a migration

```shell
rails g migration AddNameSlugToPersons name_slug:string
rails db:migrate
```

### I18n support

Make sure you have locale files in place


```ruby
I18n.with_locale(:de) do
  person = Person.create!(name: "WÃ¶rter")
  person.name_slug #=> "worter"
end
```
